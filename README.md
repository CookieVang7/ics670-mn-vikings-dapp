# ics670-mn-vikings-dapp
ICS670 semester project making a dapp to hypothetically make decisions on behalf of the GM of my favorite football team, the Minnesota Vikings

## Rules of the DApp
- The people in the network are dubbed "SkolFaithful". To join SkolFaithful, one must pay the season ticket holder price of $500.
- There are three features SkolFaithful needs to vote on: Head coach hiring, free agents to sign, and Round 1 of the draft.
- For each feature, there will be five top proposed ideas in voting. These features are known as "The Podium"

### Minnesota Vikings Coins (MVCs) and REP Tokens
- Every new member of SkolFaithful gets 4 newly minted Minnesota Vikings Coins (MVCs).
- In order for someone in SkolFaithful to submit a proposal for a feature, they must pay 4 MVCs along with their choices.
- It costs 2 MVCs to vote for a proposal. A proposal counts as a vote without no additional MVC charge.
- For each feature, MVCs will be distributed in the following order:
    - Each person who voted for a proposal that ended up on The Podium receives 1 MVC.
    - Each person who voted for a proposal that ended up on the top 2 spots on The Podium receives 1 MVC.
    - The owner of the top Podium proposal receives 70% of the remaining MVCs.
    - The owner of the second Podium proposal receives the remaining 30% of the MVCs.
    - Any MVCs contributing to proposals not on The Podium are destroyed!
- For each feature, newly minted REP tokens will be distributed as follows:
    - 1st and 2nd place receive 5 REP tokens
    - 3rd and 4th place receive 4 REP tokens
    - 5th place receives 3 REP token
    - Each person who voted for either one of the top two proposals receives 1 newly minted REP token 
- Any member of SkolFaithful that doesn't vote or submit a proposal for a feature loses 1 MVC and 1 REP token.
- Any member of SkolFaithful can buy 1 MVC for $100.
- Any member of SkolFaithful can trade in 1 REP token for 2 newly minted MVCs.
